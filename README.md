Developer Tools to manage and monitor drones, UAVS and medical embedded devices for cost effective monitoring for water management and reducing water wastage. 

Crowdsourcing information sharing for better and cleaner drinking water, Remote Water Monitoring, Recyclability of Water.

Our platform solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes NFT.Storage, IPFS and Axelar powered solutions with BNB audit contracts and Fantom destination chain for sorting information obtained from a variety of drone cameras deployed at monitoring spots.

How it works:

Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with a front end application with NFT.Storage (IPFS/Filecoin)  

Object Detection using open source solutions and Pytorch/Tensorflow deep learning library using CNN neural networks.

Video analytics configuration using NFT.Storage for data retrieval.

Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using open source solutions for streaming, Litprotocol for security and NFT.Storage for snapshots.

Alarm storage using Ethereum. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. Store the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using NFT.Storage. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm

Blockchain Eco-system

1. Binance: Binance: Binance smart contract implementation onn light client at https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/Water-ICM/tree/main/BSC-Smart-Contract-Implement/Smart-Contract-Implement-Light-Client and Binance audit smart contract implementation for Third Party administrators (TPAs) at 
https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/Water-ICM/tree/main/BSC-Smart-Contract-Implement/BSC-WaterICM-Audit-Platform%20

2. Axelar, Polygon and Fantom: Axelar for communication between Polygon blockchain (infrastructure companies and Contract research organizations) and Fantom destination chain (compliance system by government organizations like Ministry of Water or Jal Board)

3. Polygon: Polygon audit contracts.

4. Multi-Chain: MultiChain Webapp integration with EtherCalc for analysis, tabulation, graphing, charting and visualization. 

5. Covalent:  Covalent-NFT-Dashboard enables us to analyze, observe all NFTs from wallet address of Contract Research Organizations (CROs), water Quality assurance companies in different networks.
